 * The newly added Stream API (java.util.stream) introduces real-world
 * functional-style programming into the Java. This is by far the most
 * comprehensive addition to Java library intended to make Java developers
 * significantly more productive by allowing them to write effective, clean, and
 * concise code. Stream API makes collections processing greatly simplified (but
 * it is not limited to Java collections only as we will see later). Let us take
 * start off with simple class called Task.

	/**
	 * There are a couple of things going on here. Firstly, the tasks collection
	 * is converted to its stream representation. Then, the filter operation on
	 * stream filters out all CLOSED tasks. On next step, the mapToInt operation
	 * converts the stream of Tasks to the stream of Integers using
	 * Task::getPoints method of the each task instance. And lastly, all points
	 * are summed up using sum method, producing the final result. Before moving
	 * on to the next examples, there are some notes to keep in mind about
	 * com.singking.streams (more details here). Stream operations are divided into
	 * intermediate and terminal operations. Intermediate operations return a
	 * new stream. They are always lazy, executing an intermediate operation
	 * such as filter does not actually perform any filtering, but instead
	 * creates a new stream that, when traversed, contains the elements of the
	 * initial stream that match the given predicate Terminal operations, such
	 * as forEach or sum, may traverse the stream to produce a result or a
	 * side-effect. After the terminal operation is performed, the stream
	 * pipeline is considered consumed, and can no longer be used. In almost all
	 * cases, terminal operations are eager, completing their traversal of the
	 * underlying data source. Yet another value proposition of the com.singking.streams is
	 * out-of-the box support of parallel processing. Let us take a look on this
	 * example, which does sums the points of all the tasks.
